            <img src="C:\Users\ASUS\Pictures\Amrapali.jpeg"title="Amrapali Institute"height="200px"/>
            <p>This is my project 1.For this landing page we use HTML,CSS.Html makes the structure of the page and Css is used for designing the page to look the presentation attractive and intresting.the picture I have used is this project id basically downloaded from the google.I made a new landing page for our college Amrapali Group Of Institute .

In this HTML file ,we will find a basic structure that include a header section for the page header,a section with an id of "hero"for the hero section and additinal section of different section of landing page,such as features and a call to action.

Within each section,appropiate HTML element are used to structure the content.For example heading(h1,h2) are used to provide title and subtitle,tags for paragraph,and ul ,li tags for lists.

The CSS file is linked to the HTML file using the link tag with head section.it contain styles that are applied to the HTML element to enhance the visual presentation to the landing page.This include defeing colors,font,margin,padding,backgrounds,other properties to achieve the desired look and feel.

By containing the HTML and CSS files the landing page is created,giving a virtual appealing design.It provide a claer structure,readble text,and virtually appealing elements to engage visitors and guide them through the content on the page.
